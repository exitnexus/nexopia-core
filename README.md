# Nexopia Ruby Core Library

## Legal Notes

Please Note: This source code is released as-is, and is not intended to be usable
to produce a fully working site like Nexopia. Many assets and supporting code
have been omitted, and much of this code can't be used without the supporting
infrastructure. It is also extremely out of data and likely full of security issues
that we weren't aware of at the time.

It is for historical reference only. However, if code in here is useful and you are
responsible with it, it has been licensed under a permissive license so it can maybe
have some new life elsewhere.

It has been released with the permission of the current managers of Nexopia. If 
any code in this repository claims to be licensed differently than the root Apache2
license, that takes precedence. If you believe your code or assets have been wrongfully
included in this or any other repository in the [exitnexus github organization](https://github.com/exitnexus), 
please email megan@stormbrew.ca and/or source@nexopia.com  and we can discuss it.
